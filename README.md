## About Me

I've always had a interest in logic and creating, even as a kid I've loved stratgey games wghere you really need to think about what you're doing.My broader interests have always been mathematics and technology.

My natural interests in all of these things have led me to pursue a Computer Science degree at UIC, where I hope to eventually use that degree to go into anything related to Software Engineering, AI and Machine Learning.

I currently have experience in Java, Python and C/C++
